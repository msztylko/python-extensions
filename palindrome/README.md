# Palindrome

`cases.txt` contains a bunch of sentences with some of them being [palindromes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome). Example: 
> Wonâ€™t lovers revolt now?

`palidromes.txt` is a list of valid palindromes from `cases.txt`

The task is to find and print all the lines from `cases.txt` that are palindromes.

`test.sh` is a basic benchmark for this problem

```bash
./test.sh python find_palindromes.py

real	0m0.131s
user	0m0.113s
sys	0m0.014s
```
