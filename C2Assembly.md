For certain C programs the translation to assembly is rather straightforward, for example [Fibonacci sequence](https://github.com/msztylko/python-extensions/blob/master/fibonacci/c_fib.c) and its [assembly version](https://github.com/msztylko/python-extensions/blob/master/fibonacci/asm_fib.asm). This is not as easy for more complicated programs as [palindrome](https://github.com/msztylko/python-extensions/blob/master/palindrome/c_palindrome.c). And even
